# The Future of Web3 Adult Content. How are we using Porn in the Metaverse? NFTs.

## The Fall of Legacy Porn Industries 📉
The adult content industry is a hard area to build a business.
- Investors are scared to associate with you.
- Users don't like to share your content.
- Everyone uses you like a dirty secret from an incognito tab.
- Nobody wants to pay for it.
- Companies ban you from their services and platforms.
- Google will filter you from their search results.
- Legalities about pornography vary around the world.
- Protecting copyright and ownership is difficult.

It is not the ideal business environment. 😐

## The XXX-Metaverse 👽
Facebook has just announced their company name change to "Meta".
Internet experiences are being "metaversed" and porn will not be an exception.

### The XXX-Metaverse is here.

We live in new age of VR Porn, $NUDE NFTs, rentable Discord escorts, and robotic internet controlled buttplugs…
How can we ensure the XXX-Metaverse stays safe, accessible and user friendly for the adult content industry?

## Web3 + Adult Content = $NUDE NFTs 🚀
How can Web3 and the adult content industry come together?
- Hosting porn content can become decentralized with the use of IPFS.
- NFTs can give adult content creators ownership of their content.
- Profiles can be anonymous and secure using wallet signature authentication.
- NFT permission technologies such as Pinata's submarining can keep your adult content private.
- Creators can get paid higher profits in cryptocurrency without legacy banks and payment processers getting in the way.

# Identity Verification in a Decentralized World 👀
The cryptocurrency and Web3 community is known to value anonymity, privacy and security. 
However, a requirement of all functional adult content businesses today is identity and age verification of creators.

How can we bring the required safety, verification and legal process for adult content creators to the Metaverse. 
While still preserving the anonymity, privacy and security we cherish so much?

Visa and Mastercard have pulled their charging services from Pornhub, and Pornhub has announced plans to verify all the content on its platform after child abuse investigations.

# Our Mission at Own Me 🍬
We are creating the next generation adult content platform for creators and collectors using the power of NFTs, Ethereum and Web3.

### Own Me is a community to buy, trade, sell, view and promote your hottest digital "assets" as NFTs.

The $NUDE token represents our community's economy in the Ethereum blockchain.

We are working on a AI / ML assisted, human moderation process to handle verifying adult NFT content and creator profiles safely and legally in the Web3 paradigm. Our goal is to not only provide this service for our platform, but to develop it into a public Metaverse API that developers can use to verify wallet addresses as legal adult creators in their own apps.
