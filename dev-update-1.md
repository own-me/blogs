# Dev Update #1: Laying the Foundation for Own Me inside the xxx-metaverse.

### We are pleased to provide an update at Own Me Inc. about the status of our recent development. 
We will do monthly development updates going forward to keep in touch with the community. Now let’s get into the juice…

## Dapp Screenshots Teaser
All screenshots are our real open-source frontend app, not just Figma mockups. You will never see us post adult content on social medias since we don’t want to get banned. Images are just placeholders, use your imagination ;)

## Admin and Moderation Dapp
One of our biggest challenges as an adult content NFT marketplace is:

```How do we keep our community content legal, safe and private in the web3 paradigm?```

We have made an open-source back-office admin app just for moderating user reports, bans, IPFS unpinning, image takedown requests, age verifications, 1 on 1 user support chats and more…

Backoffice User Profile Moderation

Our team will use this open-source app to moderate our community and keep it in standards with government requirements as transparent to the web3 userbase as technically possible, while preserving user privacy.

## $NUDE and $NUDE_NFT Contracts
Our open-source $MATIC smart contracts are functioning amazingly in Polygon’s Mumbai testnet. We have not deployed to mainnet yet, as it is still too early. We have a philosophy that our dapp must be ready to use before we deploy $NUDE to mainnet as we value functionality > speculation.

## ProtonMail ownme.io Email Provider

![Screenshot 2022-03-22 230703](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27584221/159837357-952bb459-4326-46f4-ae52-861018ed7393.png)

We are using ProtonMail to host our contact@ownme.io email. We believe in de-googling as much as possible and using E2E encryption. Feel safer when chatting with our team and discussing private information.

## Matomo Web Analytics

![Screenshot 2022-03-22 230739](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27584221/159837369-07cb5287-f89c-4e44-9e51-b34d614a1e5b.png)

We still needed a way to track some basic user analytics on our website to see user counts, growth, geographics and device usage. Again, we always try and use the most privacy focused alternative and de-google. Matomo does a great job and in our opinion is web3 certified.

## Estimate on Testnet Launch

We think we can release a functional testnet that is ready for public use by summer 2022. We are pretty solid on the core NFT tech, but still have some work to do in the legal / moderation area for adult content. 3~ more months.
